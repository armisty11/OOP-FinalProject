## Overview

For our first week, our main focus was on brainstorming and planning the foundation of our project. I initially asked each member to propose libraries and features that could be integrated into our system. Everyone actively participated and presented different, creative, and well-thought-out ideas; each one unique and useful in its own way. Because of this, we actually struggled a bit to decide which ideas to include, since all of them were worth considering.

Despite that, the process turned out really well. We collaborated smoothly, exchanged opinions respectfully, and made sure everyone’s voice was heard. I’m genuinely proud to say that I chose the best people to work with, because so far, there have been no issues when it comes to communication and teamwork. Our team’s creativity and cooperation truly made the planning phase both productive and enjoyable.

## Task Distribution and Planning

After finalizing the project concept, datahabit, our group focused on assigning specific roles and responsibilities to ensure a clear direction and accountability from the very beginning. This allowed us to organize our workflow effectively and prepare for the development phase in the upcoming weeks.

The use of GitHub for project collaboration and version control was required by the instructor, allowing transparent tracking of each member’s commits and contributions. In addition, our group utilized a Messenger group chat for coordination, progress updates, and quick communication during the planning stage.

Our project lead, **Dahe, Aira Grettel C.**, managed the GitHub repository setup, established the initial project folder structure, and oversaw documentation and testing plans. 
**Dellosa, Karylle L.** served as the concept proposer and main coder, responsible for designing the core analysis logic of the library, including how the system detects and labels behavioral patterns.
**Hayag, Carmel Mariane T.** handled documentation, particularly drafting the README file and assisting in writing the narrative reports to document the group’s progress and decisions.
**Java, Armisty Genia L.** worked on visualization planning, preparing how the habit data would be presented through graphs and charts for clearer interpretation.
**Trillo, Rodney G.** focused on data handling, particularly the timestamp and data cleaning module, to ensure datasets are properly processed before analysis.

All in all, Week 1 was centered on establishing our foundation — finalizing the concept, clarifying everyone’s responsibilities, and ensuring all members were aligned with our project goals. This clear division of work allowed us to prepare to start Week 2 with direction, focus, and enthusiasm for bringing *datahabit* to life.

## Repository Setup and Documentation

After completing the initial brainstorming and planning phase, our group proceeded to organize the project repository and set up its structure. We wanted to make sure our workspace was organized and easy to navigate begore starting the actual development. We arranged the repository in a way that each part of the project would have its proper place and purpose. 

We decided to create four main directories: **Proposals**, **Reports**, **Final Project**, and **Docs**. Each served a specific function—Proposals for initial project concepts, Reports for weekly updates, Final Project for the implementation of our Python library, and Docs for documentation and reference materials. We also added important files such as **.gitignore**, **.gitattributes**, and the **MIT License** to ensure proper project setup and adherence to open-source standards.

The **README.md file** was then updated to include the project’s title, objective, and contributor details. We wanted it to clearly explain what the project was about and serve as a quick guide for anyone viewing our repository.

Overall, the setup process went smoothly. By the end of the week, we successfully built a structured and well-documented repository that laid the foundation for the upcoming coding and testing phases.
